1. Executive Summary
is a local-first personal finance and cash ledger app for iOS that helps users manage multiple books, record cash in and cash out transactions, import statement data, track goals, and generate reports. The product is designed to give users a fast, clean, and reliable way to manage day-to-day finances from a mobile device without depending on cloud connectivity.
The app focuses on three core outcomes:
Make bookkeeping simple and fast
Improve visibility into balances, income, and spending
Reduce manual work through statement import and export tools
2. Problem Statement
Many users track cash flow using paper notes, messaging apps, spreadsheets, or fragmented finance tools. These workflows create recurring problems:
Balances are hard to maintain accurately
Data is split across multiple personal or business contexts
Statement data must be entered manually
Duplicate entries are common after re-importing statements
Reports are difficult to generate quickly
Savings goals are tracked outside the bookkeeping workflow
Merokhataaddresses these pain points by providing a structured, mobile-first ledger app with multiple books, transaction management, reporting, analytics, and statement import support.
3. Product Vision
Build a polished iOS bookkeeping app that feels simple enough for daily use while being powerful enough to replace ad hoc spreadsheets and notes for personal and small-scale financial tracking.
4. Product Goals
Enable users to manage multiple independent books from one app.
Make transaction entry, editing, and tracking fast and intuitive.
Support statement import from PDF and XLS files with preview before saving.
Prevent duplicate imports from repeated statements.
Provide meaningful reports and visual financial insights.
Help users track savings goals with live progress updates.
Maintain a premium, minimal, and theme-aware iOS experience.
5. Non-Goals
The following are explicitly outside the initial scope:
Cloud sync or account-based backup
Multi-user collaboration
Live bank integrations
OCR for scanned, image-only statements
Investment portfolio management
Loan, credit, or debt repayment planning
Automation or recurring import scheduling

6. Target Users

Individuals tracking daily personal finances
Freelancers managing cash flow manually
Small shop owners or side-business operators
Users who maintain separate books for different purposes
